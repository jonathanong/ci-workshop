## Jest

We again use `jest` for our React tests.

## Snapshot Tests

Snapshots are the easiest types of React tests to write as they just
render your component to a DOM tree, then save it. Your test is just then
comparing your component DOM tree to the saved snapshot. If something
has changed, you can update the snapshots manually.

For declarative, stateless components, this may be all you need.
It's a great 80/20 to get coverage.
