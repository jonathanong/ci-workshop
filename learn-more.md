## Missed Topics

- Visual Regression Testing - at DSC, we use [Percy](https://percy.io/) to diff our Storybook versions. I did not include this in this workshop because it is insanely expensive.
- Cross-browser Testing - with Selenium, you can run your automation tests in almost any browser, local or remote. This was not covered because, again, it costs money to setup.
- Migrations - how do you integrate migrations into your continuous delivery cycle? Honestly, I don't know yet - I do it manually.
- Testing Strategy - as your test suite becomes large and slow, you need to put in place a good testing strategy. This was not covered as it's very high level, but may be added in the future.
